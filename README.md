- I would say that Strategy 1 and 2 have quite some similarities here. The approach I am thinking there
- would be to use Semaphores, by allowing 1 guest in at a time. When a guest go in the room they acquire
- and when they exit they release that semaphore and allow entrance for other guest to enter the room
