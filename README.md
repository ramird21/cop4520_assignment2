- I would say that Strategy 1 and 2 have quite some similarities here. The approach I am thinking there
- would be to use Semaphores, by allowing 1 guest in at a time. When a guest go in the room they acquire
- and when they exit they release that semaphore and allow entrance for other guest to enter the room
- For as far that I can see Strategy 3 may introduce some race conditions, I am not sure as of how to
- work around it. Thus, I will proceed with Strategy 2 to implement this...
